My contributions for the [Advent Of Code 2021 event](https://adventofcode.com/2021) written in C# with dotnet 6!

_Keep in mind that this code is written after work for fun, not for flexing my skills. This repo might not contain the best code I could write._ 😉

## Run
- Install [dotnet 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
- go into the specific day directory you want to run and type `dotnet run` in the terminal.
  - You can also use Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Rider, whatever you want!

## Contributing
No contributions are welcome because this is my own challenge! But if you have any feedback, feel free to create an issue. 😋

## Special thanks!
The advent of codes badges are awesome and created by [J0B10](https://github.com/J0B10/aoc-badges-action)!
